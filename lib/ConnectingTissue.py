Class: ConnectingTissue

The class receives:
    a 2d list of size 3xn (x vals, y vals and z vals) of the coordinates
        where the length of the x_vals, y_vals, and z_vals must be equal
    connections (dict): a dictionary that contains node connectons.
        The order of these connections is correct but the direction is not correct for every fiber
        example: 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3->4, 9->8, 8 -> 7, 7->6, 6 -> 5
    *con_from_1_to_2: can take multiple values as the connecting tissue connects two surfaces together
        connections to external surfaces with the this fibers node as the key and the other surfaces node as the value
        
Attributes:
    nodes (list(list(float),list(float),list(float))): The provided 2d Array of 3d coordinates
    graph (dict{int : int}): a dictionary of nodal connections: # think chains
        example: 0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3->4, 5->6, 6 -> 7 
        If you look, 0 is the start and 4 is the end as 4 does not appear as a 'key' in the dictionary and is not linked to another node
        Likewise 0 is not a connection to another node as it is never a 'value' in the dictionary
        So therefore 0 is the starting node and 4 is the ending node and 1,2,3
    fiber_keys (list(list(int))): a list of the indexes of the fibers, for example the first item in the list will contain the indexs for all the nodes that are in that fiber
    starting_nodes (list(int)): the indexes of the nodes that connect to surface1
    ending_nodes (list(int)): the indexes of the nodes that connect to surface2
